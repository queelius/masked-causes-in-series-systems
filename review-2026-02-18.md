## Review Summary

**Overall Assessment:** The paper is a well-structured foundational reference for the C1--C2--C3 likelihood framework. The series system model (Sections 2--3), observational model (Section 4), and core likelihood derivation (Section 5) are correct and clearly presented. The identifiability theorem (Theorem 9, "Identifiability under C1--C2--C3") is the key original result, but its proof of Part (b) remains a sketch that omits the central algebraic steps---this gap was flagged in the previous review and is still present. A second mathematical error appears in Remark 7 (linear independence of hazard functions), where exponential hazard functions are described as "linearly dependent"---this is false. Four references identified by the prior art survey as closing a 2013--2025 gap are absent from both `refs.bib` and the text.

**Recommendation:** minor-revision

**Strengths:**
1. The stepwise derivation of the C1--C2--C3 likelihood (Sections 5.1--5.3) is pedagogically strong: each condition's role is stated, applied, and illustrated with "what breaks without" paragraphs that make the logic transparent.
2. The necessary condition proof of Theorem 9 Part (a) is complete; the remediation discussion following it is practically useful.
3. The worked exponential example (Section 6.4) is numerically correct and concretely illustrates the recipe.
4. The four-censoring-type treatment is thorough and the combined likelihood handles all cases consistently.
5. The information-theoretic characterization of C2 (Remark 3) is an appropriate addition; deferral of the formal proof to the companion paper is handled correctly.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The proof of Theorem 9 Part (b) (sufficient condition for identifiability) is a sketch; the critical step from equation (eq:ident-proof) to h_j = h_j' is asserted but not derived. **[FIXED 2026-02-18: proof expanded with explicit Steps 1--3.]**
2. ~~Remark 7 contains a mathematical error.~~ **[RETRACTED: reviewer error. Constant functions ARE linearly dependent in function space.]**
3. Four references recommended after the prior art survey (craiu2004, lindqvist2023, liu2021, monterrubio2024) have not been added to `refs.bib` or cited in the paper.
4. The C3 condition definition uses j' without re-establishing its meaning within the condition statement itself.

## Major Issues

### Issue 1: Proof gap in Theorem 9, Part (b) --- identifiability sufficient condition

**Location:** Section 5.6, proof of Part (b), lines 1249--1273

**Problem:** The proof assumes L(theta) = L(theta') for all data sets and considers a single exact failure at time t with candidate set c. This gives equation (eq:ident-proof):

    -sum_l H_l(t) + log sum_{j in c} h_j(t)  =  -sum_l H_l'(t) + log sum_{j in c} h_j'(t)

for all t > 0 and all c in S. The proof then says: "Differentiating with respect to t for two candidate sets c1, c2 with j in c1, j not in c2 and subtracting yields a relation that isolates the contribution of component j. Specifically, from the survival terms we obtain sum_l h_l(t) = sum_l h_l'(t), and from candidate sets separating j we obtain that h_j(t) = h_j'(t) for all t > 0 whenever h_1,...,h_m are linearly independent."

Neither conclusion is derived. The missing steps are:

Step A: Obtaining sum_l h_l = sum_l h_l'. Differentiating (eq:ident-proof) with respect to t yields:

    -sum_l h_l(t) + (d/dt log sum_{j in c} h_j(t)) = -sum_l h_l'(t) + (d/dt log sum_{j in c} h_j'(t))

This contains both the survival-term difference AND the log-sum-hazard derivative difference. The proof does not show how sum_l h_l = sum_l h_l' is extracted from this.

Step B: Going from sum_l h_l = sum_l h_l' and the ratio constraints (from subtracting (eq:ident-proof) for c1 from (eq:ident-proof) for c2) to h_j = h_j' pointwise. This is where the linear independence condition does the work, but the argument is not given. The ratio constraints say (sum_{j in c1} h_j)/(sum_{j in c2} h_j) = (sum_{j in c1} h_j')/(sum_{j in c2} h_j'), which combined with separability and linear independence should force h_j = h_j', but this requires explicit algebra.

**Suggestion:** Either (a) expand the proof to provide these two steps explicitly---a full proof is probably 5--8 additional lines and uses: subtract (eq:ident-proof) for c1 from (eq:ident-proof) for c2 to eliminate survival terms, obtaining log-ratio constraints; use separability to cover all components; invoke linear independence to conclude equality componentwise. Or (b) mark the proof as a "proof sketch" and cite the companion paper for the formal argument. Option (a) is preferable for a foundational reference paper.

### ~~Issue 2: Mathematical error in Remark 7~~ RETRACTED (reviewer error)

**Status:** The paper is correct. Exponential hazard functions h_j(t) = lambda_j are constant functions --- all scalar multiples of the constant function 1. For m >= 2, constant functions are linearly dependent in function space: a_1 * lambda_1 + a_2 * lambda_2 = 0 has the nontrivial solution a_1 = -lambda_2, a_2 = lambda_1. The reviewer confused "distinct as real numbers" with "linearly independent as functions of t." No change needed.

## Minor Issues

### Issue 3: Undefined symbol j' in Condition 3 definition

**Location:** Section 5.3, Condition 3, lines 898--907

**Problem:** The formal definition of C3 writes `beta_i := Pr{C_i = c_i | T_i = t_i, K_i = j'}` but j' is not defined within the condition statement. It was introduced in C2 as "any element of c_i," but a condition statement should be self-contained. A reader consulting C3 directly will not know what j' refers to.

**Suggestion:** Add a parenthetical: "where j' denotes any element of c_i (well-defined under C2, which ensures the probability is the same for all such j')."

### Issue 4: Four prior-art-survey references missing from refs.bib and paper

**Location:** `refs.bib` and Section 1.2 (Related Work)

**Problem:** The `.papermill.md` file records that the 2026-02-17 prior art survey identified four Tier 1 references to close a 2013--2025 gap: craiu2004, lindqvist2023, liu2021, and monterrubio2024. None appear in `refs.bib` or in the paper. This is particularly important given the paper's role as a foundational reference and Theorem 9's identifiability result, which should be situated relative to lindqvist2023 (identifiability theory for competing risks).

**Suggestion:** Add these four references to `refs.bib` with correct bibliographic data, then incorporate them in Section 1.2. Based on `.papermill.md` notes: lindqvist2023 is directly relevant to Theorem 9 and should appear near the identifiability discussion; monterrubio2024 (comprehensive review) should appear in Related Work to situate the paper in the current literature; craiu2004 and liu2021 contrast with the parametric/frequentist approach.

### Issue 5: Hypothesis "at least some observations are exact failures" in Theorem 9(b) is stated as a data condition rather than a model condition

**Location:** Theorem 9, Part (b) statement, line 1223

**Problem:** The theorem includes "at least some observations are exact failures (type E)" as a hypothesis. Identifiability is a property of the statistical model (the population distribution of observables), not of a realized data set. The condition should be stated as: "the masking mechanism assigns positive probability to exact-failure events," which is a model-level statement. As written, the theorem appears to make identifiability depend on which data happened to be observed, rather than on the model structure.

**Suggestion:** Replace "at least some observations are exact failures (type E)" with "the observational mechanism assigns positive probability to exact-failure events (type E)." Then note in the proof that the single-exact-failure data set has positive probability under this assumption.

### Issue 6: x_{min,j} appears in Table 4 (Pareto row) but is absent from notation table (Table 1)

**Location:** Table 1 (lines 200--219) and Table 4, Pareto row (line 1579)

**Problem:** Table 1 claims to summarize "the principal notation used throughout the paper." The parameter x_{min,j} (Pareto location parameter) appears in Table 4 but not in Table 1. All other notation introduced in the distribution table is either self-explanatory or covered by the prose below the table.

**Suggestion:** Either add x_{min,j} to Table 1 with description "Location (minimum value) parameter for Pareto component j," or add a sentence below Table 4.

### Issue 7: Companion paper bibliography entries may be out of date

**Location:** `refs.bib`, entries towell2025model-selection, towell2025weibull-series, towell2025exponential-series

**Problem:** These are listed as "In preparation" with year 2025. The current date is 2026-02-18. Remark 3 (information-theoretic C2) cites towell2025exponential-series for a formal proof; if this paper now exists as a preprint with a DOI, the reference should be updated to provide readers a stable link.

**Suggestion:** Verify the current status of companion papers. If towell2025exponential-series exists in a citable form (arXiv, OSF, Zenodo), update the `refs.bib` entry to include the URL/DOI and change `note` from "In preparation" to "Preprint" or "Available at: ...".

## Suggestions

1. **Add a brief discussion of finite-sample implications of identifiability.** Theorem 9 establishes population-level identifiability. Practitioners need qualitative guidance on how masking rate and sample size jointly affect numerical convergence near the identifiability boundary. A two-sentence qualitative remark would make the theorem more actionable.

2. **Consider moving the worked exponential example to after Table 4.** Currently the flow is: recipe (Section 6.3) -> example (Section 6.4) -> distributions table (Section 7). Moving the example after the table would give the flow "recipe -> distributions -> example," consistent with the stated intent of providing families as "common starting points" for applying the recipe.

3. **Expand the conclusion.** Section 9 summarizes but adds no perspective. For a paper explicitly positioned as a foundational reference for an ecosystem of companion papers, the conclusion is the natural place to articulate why a unified, distribution-agnostic treatment matters---why the ecosystem benefits from citing one general paper rather than building on each other's distribution-specific results.

## Status of Previous Review Issues (2026-02-17)

**Previous Major Issue 1** (Section 5 title undersells general-m result): Current title "The C1--C2--C3 Likelihood" is adequately general. **Addressed.**

**Previous Major Issue 2** (R2 proof gap at w=1): The information-theoretic remark now defers the formal proof to towell2025exponential-series. The boundary case at w=1 is no longer claimed without proof in this paper. **Addressed by deferral** -- but verify that the companion paper exists in citable form (Issue 7).

**Previous minor issues**: Email address is present (line 48). colorlinks is enabled (line 18). Bibliography recency remains an issue (Issue 4). Other previous minor issues appear resolved.
