thesis:
  claim: "This paper establishes the distribution-agnostic likelihood framework for masked series system data that all companion papers build on. It formulates the C1--C2--C3 likelihood entirely in terms of component hazard functions, derives contributions for all four censoring types, and proves formal identifiability conditions---necessary (diagnostically confounded components are non-identifiable) and sufficient (full column rank of the augmented candidate-set matrix)---that govern when component parameters can be recovered."
  novelty: "The paper's role is foundational rather than novelty-claiming. Prior treatments specialized to Exponential or Weibull families; this paper lifts the framework to arbitrary parametric hazard specifications. The identifiability theorem (necessary and sufficient conditions via candidate-set matrix rank) is the key original result; companion papers extend it to practical finite-sample analysis, optimal diagnostic design, and distribution-specific inference."
  role: "Foundational reference for companion paper ecosystem. Not targeted for independent peer-reviewed submission."

    summary: >-
      Two major issues: (1) Theorem 9(b) proof is a sketch—missing the algebra
      from eq:ident-proof to h_j=h_j' (Steps A and B not derived); (2) Remark 7
      falsely claims exponential hazards are "linearly dependent." Minor: j'
      undefined in C3, four prior-art refs missing from refs.bib, Thm 9(b)
      hypothesis stated as data condition not model condition, x_{min,j} missing
      from notation table, companion bib entries dated 2025. Suggestions: add
      finite-sample identifiability remark, move worked example after Table 4,
      expand conclusion for foundational-reference framing.

    summary: >-
      Mathematics correct; two structural issues (Section 5 title undersells
      general-m result, R2 proof gap at w=1). Minor: email, label placement,
      ToC, colorlinks, bibliography recency, DPI strictness phrasing, subsection title.

## Log

- **2026-02-17**: Initialized by papermill.
- **2026-02-17**: Refreshed to 0.2.0 schema with YAML frontmatter.
- **2026-02-17**: Quick review completed (minor revision recommendation).
- **2026-02-17**: Prior-art survey completed (4 Tier 1 references added, 2013-2025 gap closed).
- **2026-02-17**: Full refresh — filled novelty, venue candidates, companion papers table, software ecosystem section.
- **2026-02-18**: Thesis refinement — reframed as foundational reference (not submission-targeted). Claim now centers identifiability theorem as key result. Venue updated to arXiv/OSF preprint.
- **2026-02-18**: Thorough review completed (2 major, 5 minor, 3 suggestions). See review-2026-02-18.md.
- **2026-02-18**: All review issues resolved. Theorem 9(b) proof expanded; Sections 2-3 compressed (cite thesis for proofs); Section 5.5 censoring treatment unified into table + paragraph; 5 minor fixes applied.
- **2026-02-18**: Second prior-art survey (32 references screened). Added 5 new citations: flehinger1998, flehinger2002 (Flehinger-Reiser-Yashchin line), lin1996, kuo2000 (Bayesian masked-data), craiu2006 (dependent masking). See prior-art-survey-2026-02-18.md.
- **2026-02-18**: Paper at 22 pages, 35 bibliography entries, 8 theorems, zero warnings.
- **2026-02-19**: Proof audit (all 12 results checked). Found gap in Theorem 8(b) Step 3: separability does not guarantee full column rank of augmented candidate-set matrix C̃; proof's "linear independence" argument was hand-wavy when null(C̃) nontrivial. Fix: strengthened hypothesis to require full column rank of C̃ (option 3). Proof now rigorous in 3 lines. Remark 6 updated to explain that separability alone suffices for linearly independent hazard families. Abstract and conclusion updated for consistency.
